        <h4>Hello</h4>
Doctrine packages have a rich event system that fires events when almost anything happens inside the system. For you, this means that you can create arbitrary services and tell Doctrine to notify those objects whenever a certain action (e.g. prePersist()) happens within Doctrine. This could be useful, for example, to create an independent search index whenever an object in your database is saved.

Doctrine defines two types of objects that can listen to Doctrine events: listeners and subscribers. Both are very similar, but listeners are a bit more straightforward. For more, see The Event System on Doctrineâ€™s website.

The Doctrine website also explains all existing events that can be listened to.
